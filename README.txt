Code for solving the Heat Diffussion Equation in 3D.  

Iterative Solvers:
  Jacobi
  Gauss-Seidel
  Sucesssive Over-relaxation

The benchmarks/graphs folder contains the comparison of these methods by the number of iterations it takes to converge to a solution in a given timestep.  Another grpah shows time per algorithmic timestep (note: the y axis is logarithmic).
