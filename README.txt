Code for solving the Heat Diffussion Equation in 3D.  

FMA solver:
Relaxation methods
 - Jacobi
 - Gauss Siedel
 - Gauss Siedel Red-Black

The benchmarks/graphs folder contains the comparison of these methods.  

Interpolation types:
 - Trilinear
 - Cubic

Restriction types:
 - Blended
 - Direct

Discritization Methods:
 - Dackward Euler

Building
type 'make' in mglin directory to build



Iterative Solvers:
  Jacobi
  Gauss-Seidel
  Sucesssive Over-relaxation

The benchmarks/graphs folder contains the comparison of these methods by the number of iterations it takes to converge to a solution in a given timestep.  Another grpah shows time per algorithmic timestep (note: the y axis is logarithmic).
